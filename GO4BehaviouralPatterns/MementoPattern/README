The memento pattern is used to capture the current state of an object and store it in such a manner that it can be restored at a later time.
Importantly, the pattern allows for the internal state of an object to be saved without breaking the rules of encapsulation.
This design pattern is commonly used to provide an application with Undo functionality.
