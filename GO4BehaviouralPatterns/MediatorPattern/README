The mediator pattern is used to reduce coupling between classes that communicate with each other.
Instead of classes communicating directly, and thus requiring knowledge of their implementation, the classes send messages to a mediator object.
The mediator object then transmits the messages to the other classes in a manner that they can interpret.
The mediator pattern promotes loose coupling of classes by removing the direct dependencies.
It can also simplify communication in general when a program contains a large number of classes that interact
