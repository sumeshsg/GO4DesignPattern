The flyweight design pattern is used to reduce the memory and resource usage for complex models containing many hundreds,
thousands or even hundreds of thousands of similar objects.

When you need to create a very large number of objects, each requires an amount of memory to store the object's state.
Even if the storage requirements for each individual object are small, the number of objects may cause the overall memory usage to be high.
Depending upon the scenario and the target environment, the memory usage may be so high that the program cannot execute.

In some cases, the objects being created may include information that is often duplicated.
Where this is true, the flyweight pattern can be used.

Use case : Dummy Object Creation in gaming software
